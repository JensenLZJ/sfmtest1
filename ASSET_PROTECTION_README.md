# Asset Protection Setup

This guide explains how to protect your website assets (images, CSS, JS files) from direct public access.

## Files Created

1. **`.htaccess`** - Apache server configuration to block direct access
2. **`robots.txt`** - Prevents search engines from indexing assets
3. **`protect-assets.php`** - PHP script for additional server-side protection
4. **Updated `sw.js`** - Service worker updated to handle protected assets

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Apache .htaccess (Recommended)

The `.htaccess` file is already configured and will work on Apache servers. It:
- Blocks direct access to images and assets
- Only allows access when the referer is from your domain
- Includes additional security headers
- Blocks common bot user agents

**No additional setup required** - just upload the `.htaccess` file to your server.

### Option 2: PHP Protection (Alternative)

If you want additional protection or your server doesn't support .htaccess:

1. Rename your `images` folder to `protected-assets`
2. Update your HTML to use the PHP script:
   ```html
   <!-- Instead of: -->
   <img src="images/SamudraFMLogo1.png" alt="SamudraFM" />
   
   <!-- Use: -->
   <img src="protect-assets.php?file=images/SamudraFMLogo1.png" alt="SamudraFM" />
   ```

### Option 3: Server Configuration

For Nginx servers, add this to your server block:

```nginx
location ~* \.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|ico|css|js|json)$ {
    valid_referers none blocked samudrafm.com www.samudrafm.com *.github.io;
    if ($invalid_referer) {
        return 403;
    }
}
```

## Testing

After implementing, test that:
1. ✅ Images load normally on your website
2. ❌ Direct access to `https://samudrafm.com/images/SamudraFMLogo1.png` returns 403 Forbidden
3. ✅ Search engines respect the robots.txt file

## Current Status

Your website currently uses these image references:
- `images/SamudraFMLogo1.png` (appears twice in HTML)

The `.htaccess` file will protect these automatically. No HTML changes needed for the basic protection.

## Additional Security

Consider also:
- Moving sensitive assets to a non-web-accessible directory
- Using a CDN with access controls
- Implementing user authentication for premium content
- Adding watermarking to images

## Troubleshooting

If images stop loading on your website:
1. Check server error logs
2. Verify .htaccess syntax
3. Ensure your server supports .htaccess files
4. Test with different browsers/devices
